# Github user search

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

An application used for searching github users by their login. 
No form or submit button is used, the results are shown every time the input value changes.

### `No external library`

Except for creating the React project and for testing purpose, no external library is intended to be used. 
So we have developped simple components such as Typography and Button, and the CSS is wrapped inside javascript objects in order to be passed through the React attribute "style".

### `TypeScript`

Our components are typed with TypeScript in separate files.

### `Tests`

React Testing Library is used for unit tests.


### `Documentation`

The components and functions are documented with JSDoc. It could be used in addition of TypeScript for type information, and can add some specifications about the purpose and the context of each components.
